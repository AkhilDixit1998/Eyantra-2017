# Eyantra-2017
<br>
This project has been created to implement the task provided by the Eyantra Robotics Competition by Indian Institute of Technology ,Bangalore (IIT-B) under the Ministry of Human Resource Development(MHRD), Government of India.

## Motivaton
Every year in the rural areas, a lot of vegetation and crop is destroyed by animals. Due to this there is significant financial losses to the farmers. The aim of this project is to try to solve this issue in an economical and practical manner.

## Description
In this competition we utilise two automatic robot vehicles. One being a drone and the other is a ground based vehicle to act as an animal. The drone is released and with sophisticated ROS programming, image processing and detection, it locates the 'moving' ground robot and aims to catch it in the shortest possible time. In this competition, the pathway also consists of obstacles and also the robot hides itself.

## Working
Most of the programming is done in Robot Operating System in linux and python. 'C' and arduino were utilised to program the ground robot. The image processing and detection is done by Opencv library and python code.

The task completed was ROS based visual aided landing of Micro Quadcopter with Whycon based tracking.
